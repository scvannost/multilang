# Rython
A way to write code in Python, R, and/or Matlab in the same file

### Why
In computational biology, there are many tools that exist in either only Python
or only R. Even within the same project, I was having to switch from Python
(my workhorse) to R for some steps and then back to Python where I'm more
comfortable. I decided that I wanted to be able to interact with an R environment
from within Python, and that being able to write a file that could execute in
both languages was really appealing.

## install
`pip install matrython`  
Import as rython

### Development
Current build is 0.1.0  
Developed solely by me  
If you find any bugs, please place an Issue on the github.

## Features
The 2 main use cases are:  
1. `python -m rython path/to/file.ry`
2.
~~~python
#! rython
ry = rython.Master()
ry.r('...')
# or
rython.as_rython('/path/to/file.ry')
~~~

The first shows how the module can be used to run Rython .ry scripts directly. It
calls `rython.as_rython()` on the given file.  
The second shows the interact form of Rython, using its `Master` class. This allows
for an interactive experience writing in 2 (or 3) languages.

Either way, you get full access to the Python, R, and Matlab environments; can use
any library or built-in function; and can build on top of these frameworks to do
crazy things and bodge things quickly.

### Example code
Examples will be placed in the `examples` folder
