# Multilang
A way to write code in Python, R, Matlab, and/or bash in the same file

### Why
In computational biology, there are many tools that exist in either only Python
or only R. Even within the same project, I was having to switch from Python
(my workhorse) to R for some steps and then back to Python where I'm more
comfortable. I decided that I wanted to be able to interact with an R environment
from within Python, and that being able to write a file that could execute in
both languages was really appealing.

## Install
`pip install multilang`  
Import as `import multilang`

### Development
Current build is 0.1.0  
Developed solely by me  
If you find any bugs, please place an Issue on [github](https://github.com/scvannost/multilang).

## Features
The 2 main use cases are:  
1. `python -m multilang path/to/file.mul`
2.
~~~python
#! multilang
ml = multilang.Master()
ml.r('...')
# or
multilang.as_multilang('/path/to/file.mul')
# or
multilang.as_multilang('''code here...''')
~~~

The first shows how the module can be used to run Multilang .mul scripts directly. It
calls `multilang.as_multilang()` on the given file.  
The second shows the interact form of Multilang, using its `Master` class. This allows
for an interactive experience writing in 2 to 4 languages.

Either way, you get full access to the Python, R, Matlab, and shell environments; can use
any library or built-in function; and can build on top of these frameworks to do
crazy things and bodge things quickly.

### Example code
Examples will be placed in the `examples` folder 

### Changelog
v0.1.1:
  - name change
  - Suggested extension changed from `.ry` to `.mul` 
  - added bash support
  - calling `python -m multilang` on Windows calls `as_multilang_windows`

matrython==0.1.0:
  - name change to upload to PyPI
  - bug fixes

rython==0:
  - Python/R/Matlab support
  - Unit tests
